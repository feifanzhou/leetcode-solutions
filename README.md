# How does this work?
The easiest way to use this site is to browse to a specific problem on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/), and then replace `leetcode.com` in the URL with `leetcodesolutions.com`. For example, if you're working on [https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/), the corresponding solution on this site is at [https://leetcodesolutions.com/problems/reverse-integer/](https://leetcodesolutions.com/problems/reverse-integer/).

# What? Why? Who?
Oh hai ðŸ‘‹

This is a site filled with explanations for computer programming stuff, like data structures, algorithms, and example problems â€” all the stuff that you'd expect to see while preparing for technical interviews. I'm focusing on LeetCode because their problems are well-written and have a lot of variety, and LeetCode appears to be one of the most popular sites for this kind of stuff.

The idea for _this_ site came up as I recently spent several weeks [preparing for and going through programming interviews](https://feifan.blog/2019/07/22/next-steps/). I'll be the first to admit that I struggle a lot with algorithms and formal logic â€”Â it's all Greek to me. So I would spend a lot of time looking up multiple explanations of an algorithm or problem, trying to triangulate a clear explanation for myself. At some point, I'd figure out an intuitive, "oh why didn't anyone just say this" explanation that (while maybe not perfectly rigorous) made it a lot easier to understand what was going on. At some point, I started wishing there was a place I could go to from where I could devour all of these simple explanations. Since I couldn't find a good one, I figured I'd create one.

I taught myself to code when the original iPhone SDK came out, first learning C and Objective-C before moving into web technologies. Early on, as I was learning the iPhone SDK piece-by-piece from various copy-paste-and-run tutorials, I wished for a single source that would explain everything from the ground up. [IÂ created one](https://cupsofcocoa.wordpress.com) when I couldn't find what I was looking for. This site is sort of a spiritual successor to that.

I've spent a few years as an engineer at [a few startups](https://linkedin.com/in/feifanz), and I'll be joining an exciting new team at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/issuing) in a few weeks. I also [tweet occasionally](https://twitter.com/FeifanZ) and [write about other things](https://feifan.blog).

Thanks for reading, and I hope you'll find something useful here! ðŸ’›
